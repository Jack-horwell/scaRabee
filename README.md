# scaRabee: Optimization Toolkit for Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Models

scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally written as a Matlab-based application. It provides a framework for simulation and optimization of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models at the individual and population level. It is built on top of the neldermead package, which provides the direct search algorithm proposed by Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
